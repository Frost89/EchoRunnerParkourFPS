# EchoRunner

EchoRunner was inspired from Titanfall and Apex. I love how the movement physics feel in those games. I have spent many a days just air-strafing, slide-bouncing around Apex and Titanfall.

This is what the final project looks and plays like.

The Four Required Systems to build the Parkour System are:

- Wall Run
- Vertical Wall Run
- Ledge Grab and Mantle
- Slide
- Double Jump
- Dash (not really required but I like having it)
